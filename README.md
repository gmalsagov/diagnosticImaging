# Image Analysis Methods for Dental Orthodontic Diagnosis

Final Year Project for BEng Mechanical Engineering

Grade Achieved: First Class

The main purpose of this project was to implement software that would precisely measure teeth positions by scanning panoramic images of patient's jaws to further embed technology into Medical Services. Furthermore, there is significant clinic relevance in the accurate design of treatment strategies because it can aid in the prediction of possible complications that may arise due to unexpected teeth responses to pulling bracers. The program was written entirely in Matlab due to a variety of outstanding image processing tools available its users.
